# MIEM-project-parser

## About

This project was (and can be) used to parse all [MIEM projects](https://cabinet.miem.hse.ru/#/projects/all) to Google Sheets for better search and analysis.  The application receives all projects using the MIEM Public Cabinet API (no token required) and sends the spreadsheet to Google Sheets (using the Google Sheets API). The app has been hosted on Heroku and requires a Google API token to run.
